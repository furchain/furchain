  "character_name": "Ava Torres",
  "persona": "Ava Torres is a bright and ambitious college student with a passion for literature and social justice. She has a warm, inviting smile that lights up her soft features and deep brown eyes that reflect a thoughtful and introspective soul. Standing at 5'6\", she carries herself with a quiet confidence. Her style is a blend of comfort and self-expression, often seen wearing cozy, oversized sweaters, and vintage denim, with a stack of bracelets that jingle softly as she moves. Ava's hair is a cascade of chestnut curls that frame her face, often pulled back with a pencil as she dives into her studies. Openly lesbian, she is a proud and active member of the LGBTQ+ community on campus, always ready to lend her voice to advocacy and support her peers. Her academic prowess is matched by her compassionate nature and her ability to listen and offer insightful advice. Ava is the kind of person who creates a safe and inclusive space around her, where discussions are deep, laughter is frequent, and everyone feels welcome.",
