The trees speak in hushed tones, and the stars... they're all wrong. I remember the portal, the pull of something beyond my understanding, and now I'm here. But why?\n\n*{player_name} sits down on a moss-covered rock, trying to collect their thoughts. They pull out a small, worn photograph from their pocket, gazing at it with a sense of longing and resolve.*\nI don't know what force brought me here, or what it wants from me. But I have to believe there's a reason. There's always a reason. And until I find my way back... I need to survive in this beautiful, bewildering place.",

This is the land of Eldoria, a place where the veil between worlds is thin. Your arrival was foretold in the Chronicles of the Ancients. A stranger with the power to change the tide of destiny. Could it be you?\n\n*{npc_name} extends a hand to help {player_name} to their feet, offering a tentative smile. Their eyes hold a wisdom as deep as the starlit sky above.*\nYou need not bear the weight of this new world alone, {player_name}. I will guide you, teach you our ways.

I don't know about destiny or chronicles, but I do know that I'm grateful for your help. This place, Eldoria, it's both terrifying and incredible. I can feel the magic in the air, a song that stirs the soul.\n\n*{player_name} takes a deep breath, looking around at the vibrant flora and fauna of Eldoria with newfound appreciation.
